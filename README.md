===============

This is the source code for the Thankful Android Fizz Buzz App for Unit 1. 

This app is purposely incomplete. With your newly learned java skills your task is to complete this project and run it in the emulator.

Here are the requirements:

1. Create a loop inside the doButton method that will iterate the number of times given by the user.
2. For each iteration, display the string of either the number, or "Fizz" or "Buzz" depending on the value.
3. Store these values into a String Array.

Here's the definition from wikipedia on what is [Fizz Buzz](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fizz_buzz)


> Fizz buzz is a group word game for children to teach them about division.Players take turns to count incrementally, replacing any number divisible by three with the word "fizz", and any number divisible by five with the word "buzz".



For Extra Credit:

Create a separate loop, and count the number of "Buzz" words in the array.

In the logcat console, display this count.
